Calculator was crashing when try to go from mainActivity to Calculator
App due next Friday
Meeting on Saturday

DY:
- backspace needs to not crash app when trying to delete something that doesn't exist (add if statement or catch exception & do nothing)
- set 'ans' to answer variable in Calculator class when click '=' on an expression
- catch exception when invalid expression
- should display "Error" or more specific error text when invalid calculator string entered
- backspace after have clicked enter should not delete all the user string, same with left arrow and right arrow...
- implement remaining buttons to add text to string
- screen should never go longer than button area... should always stay on top of buttons
- parameterize dimensions instead of have a fixed number of possibilities...

NB:
- unit testing evaluator and handling exceptions so app doesn't close
- potentially editing strings to add missing * e.g. 888abs(8) changes to 888... An option: "Did you mean?"
- evaluating 8+ans.... should replace ans with double before evaluated by javaluator
- parameterizing xml based on size of device
- think about initializing functions to empty string instead of null
- change filepath to internal storage (if need to)
- defining functions in javaluator & testing
