pressing any key after clicking enter shouldn't clear previous string.. should just add to the previous string.. clicking AC would remove previous string from the window so user could type a new one (important)

better to use pi symbol rather than 'pi'

put symbols on LTAR, RTAR and BACKSPACE keys

clicking ans should just show `ans' instead of showing the double result (I think this is best...then when we evaluate the string using DoubleEvaluator...we can replace 'ans' with the double string before evaluating it.)

RAN# should maybe show less decimal places

Change `IllegalInput' to 'Input error' or 'Error in input'

options should go in MENU
