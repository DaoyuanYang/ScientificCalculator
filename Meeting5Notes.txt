DY:
- finish meeting minutes
- equation editing with left arrow, right arrow, backspace after computed result
- Parameterizing your layouts so they work on different screen sizes
- Buttons should always below screen
- Buttons should get smaller or bigger depending on screen size
- keep implementing buttons to add to the userString
- Remove green bar at top if possible
- make result bigger

NB:
- delete my project and my .gradle project then try pull DY's project
- work on how to handle user-defined functions
- look into saving and loading functions
- add in the tokenizer

------------------
RANDOM NOTES:

Make sure buttons always below calculator screen....
How to delete app name bar at top of app Android Studio
using Javaluator
String expression = "(2^3-1)*sin(pi/4)/ln(pi^2)";
Double result = new DoubleEvaluator().evaluate(expression);
Equation editing (i.e. after computing a certain equation, one can modify the computed equation and recompute the result)
Clicking left or right arrow or backspace after clicked enter should place cursor at end of previous userString and allow them to edit it

NB: Look into user-defined functions (how can we let user define them..and how can we parser them/show them in userString)

f1(a,b,x,y,z)
f2(a,b,x,y,z) = x^2 + a^2

x? 32.352
a? 352.235

DoubleEvaluator

replace x and a with their values in parentheses
userString
(32.352)^2 + (352.235)^2 

---> can tokenize expression using tokenizer I did to get the variables
---> x, a
---> f1(a, x)
---> "1 + 2 + 2.43958349583 + "

f3(a,b,x,y,z) =
f4(a,b,x,y,z)
f5(a,b,x,y,z)
.....................
LOOK INTO EXCEPTION HANDLING e.g. display error message when mismatched brackets...
can store functions in bespoke format
